Salhack
Salhack is a Forge mod made by ionar. Recently, ionar has made the decision to leave the project, and as such, this project is discontinued without a main developer.

This project is not maintained.

Installation
Salhack is a forge mod for 1.12.2. We provide already pre build jar files on our release page. If you want to have changes before they get officially released check our CI out. (It builds a new jar file on every change we make.) To use salhack just drop the jar file in your mods folder and start forge. Have fun!

(i did not make this hack by any means!)
